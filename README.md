# MeetupReminder

Do you ever get confused about who you're communicating with and how, with so many apps like LINE, Twitter, Facebook, etc.? Have you ever met someone great but let time pass without making plans to meet again?

Furemane(ふれまね) lets you save a friend's name, contact method, and notes from that time. You can also open other apps like LINE and Twitter directly from this app.

No more getting lost!

Do you have someone you want to keep in touch with regularly? Try setting reminders for each friend.

Cherish your connections for a long time.
